* VR.152 is not fully implemented. Right now we only validate that it is filled with something
* VR.679 is not fully implemented. For now it verifies that the charge exist, not checking that the linked period is within the charge's validity period
* VR.902 is temporary and will be changed once update and stop functionality has been implemented.
