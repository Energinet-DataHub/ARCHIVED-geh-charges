# Settlement master data for metering point - fee, subscription and tariff links

This process handles subscription, fee and tariff links for a metering point.

To create a correct wholesale settlement basis, the charges in the submitted price
lists must be linked to the metering points in Green Energy Hub, and these links must be
forwarded to the relevant market participants.

Grid access providers and the TSO must submit links for their own subscriptions, fees and
tariffs per metering point to Green Energy Hub.

When metering points are created, Green Energy Hub links all relevant taxes (and TSO tariffs).
Master data is then passed on to the relevant energy suppliers. It is then the energy
supplier's responsibility to maintain this master data for taxes and TSO tariffs, in
accordance with the collection conditions for the specific metering point.

If the link relates to a tariff marked as a tax, the energy supplier for the metering point
is responsible for correctly linking to a metering point.

Green Energy Hub passes on all links to the relevant energy suppliers, and links relating to tariffs
marked as taxes to the relevant Grid Access Provider.
