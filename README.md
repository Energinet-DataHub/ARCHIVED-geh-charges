# Charges

## Intro

Welcome to the charges domain of the [Green Energy Hub project](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/green-energy-hub)

The charges domain is responsible for keeping track of price lists of grid companies and prices set by laws on the national level (fees and taxes).

In addition, the charges domain also keeps track of which of these prices a specific market evaluation point is assigned to at any given moment in time.

These are the business processes maintained by this domain.
