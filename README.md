# Charges

## Intro

Welcome to the charges domain of the [Green Energy Hub project](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/green-energy-hub)

The charges domain is responsible for keeping track of price lists of Grid Access Providers and Transmission System Operators (TSO). A charge may be a fee, a subscription or a tariff, where the latter has the option of being a tax.

In addition, the charges domain also keeps track of which of these prices are assigned to a specific metering point at any given moment in time.

These are the business processes maintained by this domain.
