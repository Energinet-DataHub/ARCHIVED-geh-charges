# Create our own representation of a shared keyvault in development
# Then add shared secrets to this key vault an all other Terraform code in main should not need to care about the
# "local shared" key vault concept.

/*
This is a key vault provisioned in development environments in order to eliminate external dependencies.
"stub" signals that we are stub'ing away shared resources and other domains.
We ignore the settings (variables 'sharedresources_keyvault_name' and 'sharedresources_resource_group_name').

Pros and cons for using/provisioning a shared key vault stub:

Pros:
- We don't need to override e.g. azfunc appsettings
- Development environments works as similar to other environments as possible (by actually using a dedicated key vault for system-wide settings)
- We can add secrets (e.g. connection strings that are desired to be accessed for e.g. testing using Postman or other semi-automated tests requiring the secrets)

Cons:
- We could have simplified some things and saved provisioning this addition resource by completely eliminating the use of a key vault and simply
  overriding e.g. azfunc appsettings
